## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environment.

### Node
- #### Node installation

To install Node I recommend to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). 
If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

###
### Yarn installation
  After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn
